Shakespeare LLM — Fine-Tuned Text Generator

A lightweight language model fine-tuned to write like William Shakespeare, powered by Hugging Face Transformers, FastAPI, and a simple HTML frontend.
This project demonstrates end-to-end LLM deployment — from fine-tuning to real-time text generation through an API and web interface.
Generates text in Shakespearean style (or your custom fine-tuned theme).

Powered by Hugging Face Transformers (AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer).

Simple FastAPI backend for text generation.

Interactive HTML frontend to test your model.

Fully local — no external API required once the model is fine-tuned.
